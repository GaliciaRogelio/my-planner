This is my planner, it changes color depending on the time.
different colors are displayed depending on the status of the task. If it is a future task it will be green, if the task is in the present time then the task will be red in color, and it it has passed then it will be green. 

The planner incluides a saving button and a moment.js variable to display the current time on the header.
